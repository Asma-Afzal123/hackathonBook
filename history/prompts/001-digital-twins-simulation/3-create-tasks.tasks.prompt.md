## Prompt

```

```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task list for digital twins and physics simulation module with 30 detailed tasks organized by user story. Tasks include creating Module-2 folder in Docusaurus, adding three chapter files to docs and sidebar, and writing concept-first content for Gazebo physics, Unity environments, and sensor simulation. Tasks organized in phases: Setup (T001-T004), Foundational (T005-T009), User Story 1 - Digital Twins & Physics Simulation (T010-T015), User Story 2 - Simulation Environments (T016-T021), User Story 3 - Sensor Simulation (T022-T027), and Polish phase (T028-T033). Each task follows proper checklist format with IDs, story labels, and file paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown with 30 specific implementation tasks
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (documentation task)
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with detailed implementation plan
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with implementation using generated tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story for independent implementation and testing

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of tasks
