# Prompt History Record

## PROMPT_TEXT

Goal:
Author Module 3 explaining advanced perception, simulation, and navigation for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac.

Audience:
AI/robotics students familiar with ROS 2 and simulation concepts.

Chapters:
1. NVIDIA Isaac Sim
   - Photorealistic simulation
   - Synthetic data generation for training

2. Isaac ROS
   - Hardware-accelerated perception
   - VSLAM and navigation concepts

3. Nav2 for Humanoid Movement
   - Path planning fundamentals
   - Navigation for bipedal humanoids

Standards:
- Markdown (.md) for Docusaurus
- Concept-first, minimal examples
- No real hardware setup

Success:
- Reader understands Isaac's role in Physical AI
- Ready for Module 4 (VLA)

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created comprehensive specification for Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac for Advanced Perception and Navigation. The spec includes three prioritized user stories covering Isaac Sim fundamentals (P1), Isaac ROS hardware-accelerated perception (P2), and Nav2 for humanoid navigation (P3). All functional requirements, success criteria, and edge cases were documented following the concept-first approach for Docusaurus integration. The specification is ready for the planning phase.

## OUTCOME

Specification created successfully with all required sections completed. Quality checklist validated all requirements. Ready for planning phase.
