# AI-Native Book: ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the AI-Native Book, where we explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics through the lens of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2).

## About This Book

This educational resource is designed for Python-literate AI/robotics students who are new to ROS 2. The book is structured as a series of modules that progressively build understanding of ROS 2 concepts, focusing on how ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" connecting AI agents to humanoid robots.

## Module Overview

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module covers the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture and its role in connecting AI agents to humanoid robots:

- **[ROS 2 Fundamentals](./module-1/ros2-fundamentals.md)** - Introduction to ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- **[ROS 2 Communication](./module-1/ros2-communication.md)** - Understanding communication patterns and Python agent control
- **[URDF Modeling](./module-1/urdf-modeling.md)** - Robot modeling concepts and integration with ROS 2

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Students with Python programming experience
- AI/robotics enthusiasts new to ROS 2
- Developers interested in Physical AI applications
- Anyone curious about how AI agents interface with humanoid robots

## Learning Approach

Each module follows a concept-first approach with minimal examples, focusing on understanding the fundamental principles before diving into implementation details. The content is structured to be ready for direct Docusaurus inclusion and optimized for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Module 1 Introduction](./module-1/index.md) to start your journey into ROS 2 and its role in connecting AI agents to humanoid robots.
