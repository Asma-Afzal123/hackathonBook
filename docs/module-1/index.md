# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the AI-Native Book, where we explore ROS 2 as the middleware connecting AI agents to humanoid robots. This module is designed for Python-literate AI/robotics students new to ROS 2.

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the "nervous system" of robots, providing the infrastructure for different components of a robot to communicate with each other reliably and efficiently. In the context of Physical AI, ROS 2 enables the connection between sophisticated AI algorithms and the physical hardware of humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the role of ROS 2 in Physical AI
- Identify and differentiate between the core concepts: nodes, topics, and services
- Understand the different communication patterns in ROS 2 (Topics vs Services vs Actions)
- Describe how Python agents can control robots via rclpy
- Understand URDF concepts including links, joints, and kinematic chains
- Explain how URDF integrates with ROS 2 control systems

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three chapters:

1. **[ROS 2 Fundamentals](./ros2-fundamentals.md)** - Introduction to ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
2. **[ROS 2 Communication](./ros2-communication.md)** - Understanding communication patterns and Python agent control
3. **[URDF Modeling](./urdf-modeling.md)** - Robot modeling concepts and integration with ROS 2

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with general programming concepts (variables, functions, classes)
- Interest in robotics and AI applications

## Getting Started

Begin with the [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./ros2-fundamentals.md) chapter to understand the foundational concepts before moving on to more advanced topics.
