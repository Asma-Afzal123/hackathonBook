# Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac for Advanced Perception and Navigation

Welcome to Module 3 of the AI-Native Book, where we explore NVIDIA Isaac for advanced perception, simulation, and navigation for humanoid robots. This module is designed for AI/robotics students familiar with ROS 2 and simulation concepts.

## Overview

This module covers the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem for robotics:

- **[NVIDIA Isaac Sim](./isaac-sim.md)** - Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- **[Isaac ROS](./isaac-ros.md)** - Hardware-accelerated perception and VSLAM concepts
- **[Nav2 for Humanoid Movement](./nav2-humanoid.md)** - Path planning fundamentals for bipedal robots

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core capabilities of NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Explain how Isaac ROS provides hardware-accelerated perception
- Describe VSLAM concepts within the Isaac ecosystem
- Understand Nav2 path planning fundamentals for humanoid robots
- Explain navigation challenges specific to bipedal locomotion

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals (covered in Module 1)
- Basic simulation concepts (covered in Module 2)

## Getting Started

Begin with the [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](./isaac-sim.md) chapter to understand the fundamentals of photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation, then continue with [Isaac ROS](./isaac-ros.md) and [Nav2 for Humanoid Movement](./nav2-humanoid.md).
