# Module 2: Digital Twins & Physics Simulation for Humanoid Robots

Welcome to Module 2 of the AI-Native Book, where we explore digital twins and physics-based simulation for humanoid robots. This module is designed for AI/robotics students familiar with ROS 2 basics.

## Overview

This module covers the fundamental concepts of digital twins and physics simulation in robotics:

- **[Digital Twins & Physics Simulation](./digital-twins-physics.md)** - Understanding digital twins and physics concepts in Gazebo
- **[Simulation Environments](./simulation-environments.md)** - Building robot worlds in Gazebo and Unity interaction
- **[Sensor Simulation](./sensor-simulation.md)** - Simulated sensors for AI training

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain what a digital twin is and its role in robotics
- Understand physics concepts in simulation (gravity, collisions, dynamics)
- Describe how to build robot worlds in Gazebo
- Understand high-fidelity interaction in Unity
- Explain different types of simulated sensors and their applications
- Understand how simulated sensors are used for AI training

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 basics (covered in Module 1)
- Basic knowledge of physics concepts

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Digital Twins & Physics Simulation](./digital-twins-physics.md) chapter to understand the fundamental concepts of digital twins and physics simulation in robotics, then continue with [Simulation Environments](./simulation-environments.md) and [Sensor Simulation](./sensor-simulation.md).
