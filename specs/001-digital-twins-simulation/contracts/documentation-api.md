# Documentation API Contract

For a documentation-only project, the "API" consists of:

## Content Structure Contract
- All content files must be in Markdown format
- Each file must include proper frontmatter with title, sidebar_label, and description
- Content must follow the structure defined in sidebars.js
- Links must be relative for internal navigation

## Navigation Contract
- Sidebar structure must match the learning progression defined in the specification
- Each chapter must be accessible through the navigation
- Cross-chapter references must use proper relative links
